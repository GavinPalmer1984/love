# Love

I believe Love is more important than everything else.

Every important thing can be considered with Love in mind.

I recently had a conversation about the word xenophobia in which I had to request a definition because my understanding of the word seemed to be different than my friend's understanding of the word.  His definition included the word "hate".  My definition focused on the idea of "fear".  He said fear and hate are closely related.

Love can be considered in terms of quantity, quality, space, and time.  A mental state of fear or hate can be considered as some measurement of Love.  The biggest difference between fear and hate has something to do with Love of self.  The similarity between fear and hate has something to do with the absense of Love for the object of the fear/hate emotion.

I believe my friend and I ultimately agreed that using the word fear or hate was less important than the act of comitting violence against innocent people.  By bringing Love into the conversation, we were able to find agreement.  The act of comitting violence against innocent people would indicate an absolute absense of Love and would therefore be a bad thing.

So in this way I would say that the words **xenophobia**, fear, and hate are not very valuable.  You can have a fear or hate which is mild enough such that you maintain some proper amount of Love for the object of the fear/hate emotion.  There are many words like this in our vernacular.  The words **racist** and **bigot** come to mind.  The word **jingoism** comes to mind.

Sometimes people are forced to make a choice in which innocent people are harmed no matter which choice is made.  And so even the act of causing harm to innocent people doesn't prove that the person has an absense of Love for those innocent people being harmed.

We ultimately cannot know how much Love the other person has in their heart.  We can not read other people's minds.  We cannot know the difficulty of the choices which they had available.  And so I would encourage you to judge yourself with the same measure that you judge others or else you will aid in the dehumanizing effort which is against Love.

Be very cautious of people who use dehumanizing words to describe others.
